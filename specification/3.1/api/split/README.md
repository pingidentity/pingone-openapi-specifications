# Split PingOne API Specifications

This directory contains split OpenAPI specifications where the components and paths are separated into individual files.

## Structure

- `openapi.yaml` - Main OpenAPI specification file that references the split components
- `components/` - Component definitions (schemas, parameters, responses, headers, etc.)
- `paths/` - Individual path definitions

This split structure allows for easier maintenance and version control of the API specifications.
